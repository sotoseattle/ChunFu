ChunFu
======

Chinese Language Kung Fu. A way to explore Chinese words and numbers.

For numbers, it shows the logical steps to convert Chinese numbers into English.

For words, only in Chinese Traditional characters, it shows English translations (verified and unverified), deconstructs in translatable substrings (to give clues of compound words) , and also references words that share the same characters (again to provide insight).

Includes:

* Ruby language 2.0
* Sinatra DSL (modular)
* Javascript ajax bits and pieces
* Access to Postgres database w/ ActiveRecord
* Smith Waterman Algorithm
